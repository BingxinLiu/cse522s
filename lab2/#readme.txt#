MODULE DESIGN
Data Structure

In our replaceable header file, we defined two structures: task and subtask.

The task structure including:

    the period field denoting the period the task should be released,

    the subtask_count field, which on behalf of the total number of subtasks within each task,

    the task_start_idx field recording the first subtask's index in the array of subtasks,

    and the exe_time field, which is the sum of the execution time of all its subtasks.

The subtask structure is consisted of:

    the task_id field, which records which task the subtask is belonging to,

    the subtask_id field, the index for subtask,

    the exe_time field, the time used by subtask in each release,

    the timer field, which is used to wake up its successor,

    the thread field, a pointer to the subtask thread's task_struct,

    the last_realease_time field, which is recording when the subtask was released the last time,

    the loop_count field, which is calculated via "calibrate" mode and specify how many times the subtask should loop,

    the cumulative_exe_time field, recording the sum of each its precessors' execution time

    the core field, calculated in "calibrate" mod and represent which core the subtask should run on,

    and the priority field specified in "calibrate" mod, and denote the priority value of the subtask's thread.
